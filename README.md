### Hello!

I'm a second-year university student studying Software Engineering specialising in Artificial Intelligence!

I'm currently working on: University Projects mostly haha, but also games and coding challenges! I usually keep them private until I want to release a 1.0 version, but after that they're public and I try to update them regularly! (My uni projects unfortunately also mostly have to be kept private)

My pronouns are They/Any!

Thank you for reading!
